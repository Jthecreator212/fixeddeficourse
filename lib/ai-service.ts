Each participant can verify the records of its transaction partners directly, without an intermediary.\n\nTransactions are grouped into blocks, which are then linked together using cryptographic hashes, forming a chain of blocks - hence the name 'blockchain'.",

            '# Writing Secure Smart Contracts\n\nSecurity is paramount in smart contract development as vulnerabilities can lead to significant financial losses. This lesson covers common vulnerabilities and best practices for secure smart contract development.\n\n## Common Vulnerabilities\n\n### Reentrancy Attacks\n\nReentrancy occurs when external contract calls allow attackers to re-enter the original function before the first execution is complete.\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\nfunction withdraw(uint amount) public {\n    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount);\n    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");\n    require(success);\n    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;\n}\n```\n\n**Secure Code:**\n```solidity\nfunction withdraw(uint amount) public {\n    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount);\n    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;\n    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");\n    require(success);\n}\n```\n\n### Integer Overflow/Underflow\n\nBefore Solidity 0.8.0, arithmetic operations could overflow or underflow without reverting.\n\n**Vulnerable Code (pre-0.8.0):**\n```solidity\nuint8 public counter = 255;\nfunction increment() public {\n    counter += 1; // Overflows to 0\n}\n```\n\n**Secure Code:**\n```solidity\n// In Solidity 0.8.0+, overflow/underflow checks are built-in\n// For earlier versions, use SafeMath library\nuint8 public counter = 255;\nfunction increment() public {\n    counter = counter + 1; // Will revert in 0.8.0+\n}\n```\n\n### Access Control Issues\n\nImproper access controls can allow unauthorized users to execute sensitive functions.\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```solidity\nfunction transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {\n    owner = newOwner;\n}\n```\n\n**Secure Code:**\n```solidity\nfunction transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {\n    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");\n    owner = newOwner;\n}\n```\n\n## Security Best Practices\n\n### 1. Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern\n\n1. Check all preconditions\n2. Apply effects to the contract\'s state\n3. Interact with other contracts or external addresses\n\n### 2. Use Modifiers for Access Control\n\n```solidity\nmodifier onlyOwner() {\n    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");\n    _;\n}\n\nfunction sensitiveFunction() public onlyOwner {\n    // Function body\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Avoid Hardcoded Addresses\n\nUse state variables that can be updated by authorized users instead of hardcoding addresses.\n\n### 4. Implement Emergency Stops\n\n```solidity\nbool public paused;\n\nmodifier whenNotPaused() {\n    require(!paused, "Contract is paused");\n    _;\n}\n\nfunction pause() public onlyOwner {\n    paused = true;\n}\n\nfunction unpause() public onlyOwner {\n    paused = false;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Thoroughly Test Smart Contracts\n\n- Unit tests for individual functions\n- Integration tests for contract interactions\n- Formal verification for critical contracts\n\n### 6. Conduct Security Audits\n\nHave your code reviewed by professional security auditors before deploying to mainnet.',

This lesson covers testing frameworks, deployment strategies, and best practices for smart contract deployment.\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\n### Hardhat\n\nHardhat is a development environment for Ethereum software that provides a testing framework with Mocha and Chai.\n\n**Example Test:**\n```javascript\ndescribe("Token contract", function () {\n  it("Deployment should assign the total supply of tokens to the owner", async function () {\n    const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners();\n    const Token = await ethers.getContractFactory("Token");\n    const token = await Token.deploy();\n    const ownerBalance = await token.balanceOf(owner.address);\n    expect(await token.totalSupply()).to.equal(ownerBalance);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n### Truffle\n\nTruffle is a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for Ethereum.\n\n**Example Test:**\n```javascript\nconst Token = artifacts.require("Token");\n\ncontract("Token", (accounts) => {\n  it("should put 10000 tokens in the first account", async () => {\n    const tokenInstance = await Token.deployed();\n    const balance = await tokenInstance.balanceOf.call(accounts[0]);\n    assert.equal(balance.valueOf(), 10000, "10000 wasn\'t in the first account");\n  });\n});\n```\n\n### Foundry\n\nFoundry is a fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.\n\n**Example Test:**\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.13;\n\nimport "forge-std/Test.sol";\nimport "../src/Token.sol";\n\ncontract TokenTest is Test {\n    Token token;\n\n    function setUp() public {\n        token = new Token();\n    }\n\n    function testTotalSupply() public {\n        assertEq(token.totalSupply(), 10000);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Test Types\n\n### Unit Tests\n\nTest individual functions and components in isolation.\n\n### Integration Tests\n\nTest interactions between multiple contracts.\n\n### Fuzz Tests\n\nAutomatically generate random inputs to find edge cases.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testFuzz_Transfer(uint256 amount) public {\n    // Bound the amount to be within the total supply\n    vm.assume(amount <= token.totalSupply());\n    \n    address recipient = address(0x123);\n    uint256 initialBalance = token.balanceOf(address(this));\n    \n    token.transfer(recipient, amount);\n    \n    assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(this)), initialBalance - amount);\n    assertEq(token.balanceOf(recipient), amount);\n}\n```\n\n### Scenario Tests\n\nTest specific user flows and scenarios.\n\n## Deployment Strategies\n\n### Testnet Deployment\n\nAlways deploy to testnets before mainnet to validate contract behavior in a live environment.\n\n**Popular Testnets:**\n- Ethereum: Sepolia, Goerli\n- Polygon: Mumbai\n- Arbitrum: Arbitrum Goerli\n- Optimism: Optimism Goerli\n\n### Mainnet Deployment\n\n**Deployment Script Example (Hardhat):**\n```javascript\nasync function main() {\n  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();\n  console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);\n\n  const Token = await ethers.getContractFactory("Token");\n  const token = await Token.deploy();\n\n  console.log("Token address:", token.address);\n}\n\nmain()\n  .then(() => process.exit(0))\n  .catch((error) => {\n    console.error(error);\n    process.exit(1);\n  });\n```\n\n### Contract Verification\n\nVerify your contract source code on block explorers like Etherscan to enable users to interact with your contract and view its code.\n\n**Verification with Hardhat:**\n```bash\nnpx hardhat verify --network mainnet DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS [CONSTRUCTOR_ARGUMENTS]\n```\n\n## Post-Deployment\n\n### Monitoring\n\nSet up monitoring for your contracts to detect unusual activity or potential exploits.\n\n### Upgradability\n\nConsider implementing upgradable patterns for critical contracts:\n\n1. **Proxy Pattern**: Use a proxy contract that delegates calls to an implementation contract\n2. **Diamond Pattern**: Multi-facet proxy pattern allowing partial upgrades\n3. **Beacon Pattern**: Multiple proxies pointing to a single implementation',
